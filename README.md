# 🚀 HyperTextMePip - "Serving Bytes, One Pip at a Time!" 🍪

A simple HTTP server built from scratch in C#. This project is designed to help me understand networking, the HTTP protocol, and asynchronous programming.

## 🚀 Features  
✨ **HyperTextMePip** is built for speed, simplicity, and learning! Check out what it can do:  

- 🔗 **Handles Basic HTTP Requests** – GET, POST, and more!  
- ⚡ **Supports Multiple Clients Concurrently** – Because one request at a time is boring!  
- 🌍 **Implements Basic Routing** – Serve different responses based on the URL path.  
- 🎨 **Custom Response Handling** – Control how requests are processed and responses are returned.
